# Understanding ML

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/laserkelvin/understanding-ml/master)

This is a Github repo where I develop toy experiments for understanding various
aspects of machine learning. In each folder, I'll perform a self-contained
experiment that explores either a method, concept, or property of machine
learning algorithms (not just deep learning).

The key thing with many of these experiments is that I want to dive deep into
the core of concepts: unless I absolutely must, I won't be looking at the 
standard ML datasets like MNIST: the idea here is to explore the underlying
principles, which is most easily done on relatively simple (one dimensional)
data sets, which are just randomly generated functions.

I envision many of these will also be written up as blog posts, either on [my
own website](https://laserkelvin.github.io), or on
[Medium](https://link.medium.com/lBgLpxMs74).

Please feel free to use the code in this repo for your own experiments, and
contact me with any questions or comments! Forks/Issues/PRs are welcome!
