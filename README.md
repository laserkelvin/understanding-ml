# Understanding ML

This is a Github repo where I develop toy experiments for understanding various
aspects of machine learning. In each folder, I'll perform a self-contained
experiment that explores either a method, concept, or property of machine
learning algorithms (not just deep learning).

I envision many of these will also be written up as blog posts, either on [my
own website](https://laserkelvin.github.io), or on
[Medium](https://link.medium.com/lBgLpxMs74).

Please feel free to use the code in this repo for your own experiments, and
contact me with any questions or comments! Forks/Issues/PRs are welcome!
